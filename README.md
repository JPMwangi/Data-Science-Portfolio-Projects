# Data-Science-Portfolio-Projects

**Welcome to my GitHub repository!** This space showcases my data science projects and notes, developed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics coursework. 

### **Repository Structure**

* **projects:** This folder houses my completed data science projects, each with its own dedicated repository. Each project repository includes:
    * **README.md:** A detailed explanation of the project, including its objective, methodology, and key findings.
    * **data:** The dataset used for the project.
    * **code:** Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts containing the analysis code.
    * **results:** Visualizations, models, or other output files.

    * **practice_exercises:** Solutions to practice problems.
    * **personal_reflections:** My thoughts and experiences throughout the course.

### **Key Skills Demonstrated**

Through these projects and notes, I've honed my skills in:

* **Data cleaning and preparation:** Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
* **Exploratory data analysis (EDA):** Using statistical techniques and visualizations to understand data.
* **Machine learning:** Building and evaluating predictive models.
* **Data visualization:** Creating informative and visually appealing charts.
* **Problem-solving:** Applying data science methodologies to address real-world challenges.
